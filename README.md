# deep_learning_from_scratch

In this directory, I recode the deep learning algorithm from scratch with numpy in python. 

This code is for educational purposes only. 

If you want to train deep learning models, please use TensorFlow or Pytorch, which are much better optimized packages. 

Here's a script to test the code available for training a simple linear model. 

```
python examples\linear_example.py
```

Here's a script to test the code available for training a simple non linear model. 

```
python examples\non_linear_example.py
```
